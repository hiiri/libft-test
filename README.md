# libft-test
A main file to test 42 school's libft assignment.

## How to use:
1. Clone to libft repository.

	``` git clone https://github.com/salahadawi/libft-test.git ```

2. Compile with your libft.a.

	``` gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra libft-test.c libft-test-bonus.c ../libft.a ```
    
3. Run program with no arguments to test all functions, or  
```./a.out 1```, ```./a.out 2``` ```./a.out 3``` to test certain parts.

## Output
Part 1 functions are tested against the c library.

Part 2 and bonus functions are tested against expectations of function functionality.

```0``` means the function passed the test, anything else is an error.

Check libft-test.c or libft-test-bonus.c to see which test has failed.
