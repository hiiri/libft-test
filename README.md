A main file to test 42 school's libft assignment.

## How to use:
1. Clone to libft repository

2. Compile with your libft.a

	``` gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra libft-test.c libft.a ```
    
3. Run program with no arguments to test all functions, or  
```./a.out 1```, ```./a.out 2``` ```./a.out 3``` to test certain parts.

## Output

Part 2 and bonus functions are tested against expectations of function functionality.
